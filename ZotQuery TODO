ZotQuery TODO

* Fix Collection and Tag queries to read keys (instead of Names) when querying `zot:c` and `zot:tag`.

* Order filter results by:
	* date (newest to oldest)

* With Alfred action modifiers, there are 6 possible actions the workflow can take on an item:
	[x] open Zotero to item
	[x] copy full citation
	[x] copy short reference
	[x] add citation to bibliography
	* open attachment
	* ??

[x] Added Feature to export Markdown bibliography of all items in chosen Tag or Collection
