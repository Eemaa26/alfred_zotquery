**ZotQuery** is an Alfred workflow that grants the user access to the data stored in their Zotero application. The Python scripts in this repo form all of the necessary components for this workflow. 

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I am currently looking for some help in expanding ZotQuery's features by building an accompanying Zotero Plugin in JavaScript. As I do not know JS and do not have the time currently to learn it thoroughly enough to achieve my goals, I am hoping that a satisfied user or curious coder would be interested in joining me in development. I have a number of ideas, but not the technical expertise to execute them. Please contact me, either here, on GitHub, or on my blog if you are interested.</p>

To **download**, visit the [page on Packal](http://packal.org/workflow/zotquery), the workflow aggregator for Alfred, where you will be able to update to the newest versions.
